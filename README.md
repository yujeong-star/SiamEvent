This is official github of "SiamEvent: Event-based Object Tracking via Edge-aware Similarity Learning with Siamese Networks". 

We provide 'Real Event Dataset' recorded with DAVIS346 for event-based object tracking. Our dataset includes outdoor scenes with various conditions (e.g., general, dark, blurred, strong light) and camera settings (e.g., fixed camera with stand-alone moving object and moving camera with fixed scenes).
