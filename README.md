This is official repository of "SiamEvent: Event-based Object Tracking via Edge-aware Similarity Learning with Siamese Networks". 

We provide 'Real Event Dataset' recorded with DAVIS346 for event-based object tracking. Our dataset includes outdoor scenes with various conditions (e.g., general, dark, blurred, strong light) and camera settings (e.g., fixed camera with stand-alone moving object and moving camera with fixed scenes). 

The dataset link is: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mtTFQ4R3GzZRYwevmLDLrEbWOCGVlUiN?usp=sharing (~5GB)
